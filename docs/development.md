# TradeBlocks Developer Guide

This document explains how TradeBlocks is structured and how to work effectively inside the codebase. Pair it with the top-level `README.md` for quick-start instructions.

## Environment & Tooling
- **Runtime:** Node.js 20 LTS (Next.js 15 requires >=18.18, but we develop against 20 for parity with Vercel).
- **Package manager:** npm (lockfile committed). Husky installs git hooks via `npm install`.
- **Type system:** TypeScript with `strict` mode.
- **Linting:** ESLint 9 + Next.js config (`npm run lint`).
- **Formatting:** Rely on ESLint + Prettier-in-ESLint; no dedicated `format` script.
- **Testing:** Jest 30 with `ts-jest` and `fake-indexeddb` to emulate browser storage.

### First-Time Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` → you will be redirected to `/blocks`.
4. Create your first block and upload a trade CSV (sample: `IC_Trades.csv`).

> Resetting locally stored data: open your browser dev tools → **Application** tab → clear IndexedDB storage and `localStorage` key `tradeblocks-active-block-id`.

## Application Architecture

### High-Level Flow
1. **Block creation** – Users import CSV files through `/blocks` using `BlockDialog`.
2. **Parsing** – Files are parsed via `packages/lib/processing/csv-parser.ts`, converted into domain models in `packages/lib/models/*`.
3. **Storage** – Raw rows live in IndexedDB (`packages/lib/db/`). Metadata (names, timestamps, counts) persists alongside references to stored records.
4. **State management** – Zustand stores (`packages/lib/stores/`) expose application state to React components. Active block selection is cached in `localStorage` for reload persistence.
5. **Calculations** – Portfolio statistics, drawdowns, and Monte Carlo inputs are computed inside `packages/lib/calculations/*`, primarily `portfolio-stats.ts`.
6. **Presentation** – App Router routes under `app/(platform)/` render dashboard experiences powered by the stores and calculations.

### Routing & Layout
- `app/page.tsx` redirects to `/blocks`.
- `app/(platform)/layout.tsx` wires the persistent sidebar (`components/app-sidebar.tsx`) and header.
- Primary screens:
  - `/blocks` – block CRUD + activation (see `app/(platform)/blocks/page.tsx`).
  - `/block-stats` – overview cards and summary metrics.
  - `/performance-blocks` – strategy filters, equity curve charts, and performance tables.
  - `/position-sizing` – Kelly calculations and sizing guidance.
  - `/risk-simulator` – Monte Carlo simulator (see audit in `RISK_SIMULATOR_AUDIT.md`).
  - `/correlation-matrix` – cross-strategy correlation heatmap with configurable method, alignment (shared days vs zero-fill), return normalization (raw, margin, notional), and date basis (opened vs closed trades).

### State & Persistence
- **Zustand stores**
  - `packages/lib/stores/block-store.ts` – block metadata, activation, CRUD, recalculation.
  - `packages/lib/stores/performance-store.ts` – derived performance datasets and caching.
  - Additional feature-specific stores live alongside their modules.
- **IndexedDB adapters**
  - `packages/lib/db/index.ts` centralizes database initialization.
  - `packages/lib/db/trade-store.ts`, `packages/lib/db/daily-log-store.ts`, etc. manage raw data collections.
- **Data references** – `ProcessedBlock` keeps keys to related data for lazy retrieval (`packages/lib/models/block.ts`). When you fetch a block, load trades/daily logs explicitly via the store helpers.

### Calculations & Utilities
- `packages/lib/calculations/portfolio-stats.ts` – Computes win rates, drawdowns, expectancy, and normalized metrics. Uses Math.js to mirror the legacy Python implementation (sample standard deviation on Sharpe, population on Sortino).
- `packages/lib/calculations/risk/` – Monte Carlo simulation helpers powering the risk simulator.
- `packages/lib/processing/trade-processor.ts` & `daily-log-processor.ts` – Convert raw CSV strings into typed models, handling alias headers and data validation (`packages/lib/models/validators.ts`).
- `packages/lib/utils/date.ts`, `packages/lib/utils/number.ts` – Reusable formatting helpers.

### UI Components
- `components/ui/` – shadcn/ui primitives configured with Tailwind CSS.
- `components/performance-charts/` – Plotly components (via react-plotly.js) for equity curves and strategy comparisons.
- `components/block-dialog.tsx`, `components/sidebar-active-blocks.tsx`, etc. orchestrate import flows and navigation.

## CSV Schema Reference

### Trade Logs (required)
- Expected headers match OptionOmega exports (`packages/lib/models/trade.ts`). Key columns:
  - `Date Opened`, `Time Opened`, `Legs`, `P/L`, `Strategy`
  - `Opening Commissions + Fees`, `Closing Commissions + Fees`
  - Ratio columns such as `Opening Short/Long Ratio` are optional but supported.
- Aliases in `TRADE_COLUMN_ALIASES` normalize variants (e.g., `Opening comms & fees`).

### Daily Logs (optional)
- `Date`, `Net Liquidity`, `P/L`, `P/L %`, `Drawdown %` are required (`packages/lib/models/daily-log.ts`).
- When absent, drawdown calculations fall back to trade-based equity curves.

## Testing
- Global Jest setup lives in `tests/setup.ts` (auto-configured via `jest.config.js`).
- `fake-indexeddb` simulates browser storage for stores/calculations.
- Focused suites:
  - `tests/unit/` – pure functions (parsers, calculators, utils).
  - `tests/integration/` – multi-module flows (e.g., block ingestion to stats).
  - `tests/data/` – fixture CSV rows.
- Useful scripts:
  - `npm test -- path/to/file.test.ts`
  - `npm test -- path/to/file.test.ts -t "test case name"`
- Coverage reports output to `coverage/` via `npm run test:coverage`.


## Development Tips
- Use the `plans/` directory for task breakdowns if you want structured TODOs (optional).
- Tailwind CSS configuration lives in `tailwind.config.ts` produced via `@tailwindcss/postcss` (Tailwind v4). Check `app/globals.css` for design tokens.
- Components expect the `@/*` alias (configured in `tsconfig.json`)—prefer it over relative paths.
- When debugging IndexedDB, the store names mirror file names (e.g., `tradeblocks-trades`); inspect them via browser dev tools.
- `npm run build` uses Turbopack; large third-party imports (Plotly) can impact bundle size, so keep an eye on analytics when adding dependencies.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project uses Claude Code for AI-assisted development. Key files and workflows:

### CLAUDE.md

The `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file provides project context to Claude Code, including:
- Architecture overview and data flow
- Key implementation details (timezone handling, P&L calculations, etc.)
- Testing patterns and conventions
- Charting library specifics (Plotly, not Recharts)

When working with Claude Code, this file is automatically loaded to provide codebase context.

### GSD Workflow

The project uses the "Get Shit Done" (GSD) workflow for structured development:

```
.planning/
├── PROJECT.md      # Project goals and context
├── ROADMAP.md      # Milestone and phase overview
├── STATE.md        # Current position and accumulated decisions
├── ISSUES.md       # Deferred issues and enhancements
├── config.json     # Workflow mode (interactive/yolo)
└── phases/         # Phase directories with PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md files
```

**Common GSD commands:**
- `/gsd:progress` - Check current progress and next actions
- `/gsd:plan-phase <N>` - Create detailed plan for a phase
- `/gsd:execute-plan` - Execute a PLAN.md file
- `/gsd:verify-work` - Manual acceptance testing

The GSD workflow provides:
- Structured planning with explicit success criteria
- Atomic commits per task
- Accumulated context across sessions (decisions, issues, blockers)
- Subagent execution for parallel work

### MCP Server Integration

Claude Code can interact with TradeBlocks data via the MCP server:

```bash
# Add MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add tradeblocks -- npx tradeblocks-mcp ~/Trading/backtests
```

This enables analysis queries directly in the development workflow.

## Monorepo Structure

TradeBlocks uses npm workspaces to manage multiple packages:

```
tradeblocks/
├── package.json           # Root package with workspaces config
├── app/                   # Next.js web application (root)
├── components/
├── tests/
└── packages/
    ├── lib/               # Core business logic (@tradeblocks/lib)
    ├── mcp-server/        # MCP server (npm: tradeblocks-mcp)
    └── agent-skills/      # AI agent skill definitions
```

### Import Patterns

```typescript
// Library imports use the workspace package
import { Trade, PortfolioStatsCalculator } from '@tradeblocks/lib'
import { useBlockStore } from '@tradeblocks/lib/stores'

// Component imports use root-relative paths
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

### Running Workspace Commands

```bash
# Build the MCP server
npm run build -w packages/mcp-server

# Run MCP server tests
npm test -w packages/mcp-server

# Run all root-level tests
npm test
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Web app development**: Work from the repository root with `npm run dev`
2. **MCP server development**: Changes in `packages/mcp-server/src/` require rebuild with `npm run build -w packages/mcp-server`
3. **Agent skills**: Markdown files in `packages/agent-skills/` that provide guided workflows for AI assistants

For MCP server development details, see [packages/mcp-server/README.md](../packages/mcp-server/README.md).
