Enhancements discovered during execution. Not critical - address in future phases.

## Open Enhancements

### ISS-001: Hide empty result sections before analysis runs

- **Discovered:** Phase 2 Task 3 (2026-01-11)
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** The WFA page shows multiple empty placeholder cards ("Execute a walk-forward run to unlock robustness insights", "Run at least one analysis to surface suggestions", "Run an analysis to unlock timeline insights", "Run the analysis to populate this table") before any analysis has been configured or run. These add visual clutter and make the page feel unfinished. Consider hiding these sections entirely until results exist, or collapsing them into a single "Results will appear here after running analysis" message.
- **Impact:** Low (works correctly, this would enhance)
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Suggested phase:** Phase 10 (Integration & Polish)

### ISS-002: Avg Performance Delta metric needs better explanation

- **Discovered:** Phase 6 (2026-01-11)
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** Users don't understand what Avg Performance Delta means or why it matters. The current tooltip is too shallow.
- **Impact:** Medium (confusing for newcomers)
- **Effort:** Low
- **Status:** Planned for Phase 7-01 Task 1
