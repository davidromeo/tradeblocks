# Phase 6: Results Summary View - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When WFA results come back, users see a dashboard-style overview with key metrics displayed prominently. Visual indicators (green/yellow/red) help orient them to what they're looking at.

The feeling should be calm orientation — helping users understand what they're looking at, not judging good/bad or telling them what to do. TradeBlocks is about insights, not recommendations.

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clear metric explanations** - Each number has context so users know what it actually means
- **Visual hierarchy** - The most important information jumps out first, details are secondary
- **No jargon barrier** - Someone new to WFA can understand the summary without prior knowledge

All three are equally important. This phase is about making WFA accessible to newcomers.

## What's Out of Scope

- Calculation changes - We're displaying existing results, not changing how they're computed (Phase 9)
- Note: Recommendations/guidance and detailed terminology explanations may overlap with Phases 7-8, but basic clarity is in scope here

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Card-based layout matching existing parameter UI patterns
- Otherwise open to whatever approach works best for the goals

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

From Phase 1 audit: "Verdict section is hidden below charts - should be prominent" — this phase should address that concern.

Guiding principle: "Insights not recommendations" — show users what the analysis found without telling them what to do about it.
