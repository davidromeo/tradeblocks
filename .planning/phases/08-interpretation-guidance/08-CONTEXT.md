# Phase 8: Interpretation Guidance - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A dedicated "Analysis" tab in the results view that helps users understand what their WFA results actually mean. This isn't just status indicators scattered around — it's a focused space where interpretation lives.

The tab serves two audiences, but leans heavily toward newcomers who don't know what a WFA is. For them, it's an educational guide that walks them through the results. For experienced users, it's a quick reference that confirms what they already suspect.

The analysis explains three things:
1. **Why the verdict** — What factors drove the Pass/Fail/Marginal decision and what that actually means
2. **Red flags and concerns** — Specific observations about potential overfitting, inconsistency, or troubling patterns
3. **What this means for you** — Insights (not recommendations) about what the results suggest about the strategy

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Plain-language explanations** — No WFA jargon. Someone seeing these results for the first time should understand what they're looking at. Explain concepts as if talking to someone who's never heard of "in-sample" or "efficiency ratio."

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- **Historical comparisons** — Not comparing to previous runs or showing improvement over time
- **Advanced analytics** — Not adding new metrics or calculations, just explaining existing ones better
- **Prescriptive recommendations** — These are insights and observations, not "do this" advice. Careful to frame as "this suggests..." not "you should..."

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches for layout, structure, and visual treatment.

## Additional Context

Target audience split:
- Primary: Newcomers who don't know what WFA is — need hand-holding through interpretation
- Secondary: Experienced users who want quick at-a-glance confirmation

The distinction between "insights" and "recommendations" is important. We observe and explain patterns, we don't tell users what to do with their strategies.
