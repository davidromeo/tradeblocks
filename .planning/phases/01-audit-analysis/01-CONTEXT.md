# Phase 1: Audit & Analysis - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A thorough deep dive into the WFA codebase to build comprehensive understanding before making any changes. The primary goal is for Claude to understand the system well enough to work on it effectively in later phases — documentation is secondary to genuine comprehension.

This is exploration-first: understand every piece of how WFA works before deciding what to change.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Understanding the calculations** — The math behind WFA: how windows work, in-sample vs out-of-sample splitting, efficiency ratios, robustness metrics
- **Mapping the UI flow** — How users interact with WFA, what controls exist, where the pain points likely are
- Both are equally important — can't fix what you don't understand

## What's Out of Scope

No artificial boundaries on this phase. Explore thoroughly — if understanding requires looking at external WFA concepts or identifying issues to fix later, that's fine. This is about building knowledge.

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches for codebase exploration and analysis.

## Additional Context

The user wants Claude to internalize the WFA system deeply. The deliverable is understanding, not documentation. Notes and findings are useful but secondary to being able to work confidently on the codebase in subsequent phases.
