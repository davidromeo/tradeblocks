<objective>
Comprehensive review and update of all documentation before v2.0 release.

Purpose: Ensure documentation helps developers navigate the repo and get set up quickly, while providing clear paths to detailed information about each component.
Output: README as navigation hub, development.md with current architecture, consistent MCP docs.

@.planning/phases/15-polish-documentation/15-02-SUMMARY.md

**Key context from 16-CONTEXT.md:**
- Focus on comprehensive overhaul before v2.0 release
- Main README should help navigate repo and get set up for development
- Brief "what is TradeBlocks" blurb, but not a feature brochure
- MCP server docs for detailed usage; main README links to them

**Current documentation files:**
@README.md
@docs/development.md
@packages/mcp-server/README.md
@packages/mcp-server/docs/USAGE.md
@packages/agent-skills/README.md

**Known issues to address:**
1. development.md references Recharts but CLAUDE.md says project uses Plotly
2. development.md has stale "Comparison Blocks Roadmap" section (references "in progress" work)
3. development.md lacks monorepo context (npm workspaces, packages/ structure)
4. Main README is feature-heavy; should be navigation-focused for developers
5. Ensure consistent messaging across all docs

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update development guide with current architecture</name>
  <files>docs/development.md</files>
  <action>
  Review and update development.md to reflect current codebase state:

  1. **UI Components section**: Change "Recharts" reference to "Plotly via react-plotly.js" to match CLAUDE.md
  2. **Remove stale content**: Remove or update "Comparison Blocks Roadmap" section at bottom - check if this work is complete or still relevant
  3. **Add monorepo context**: Add section explaining npm workspaces structure:
     - Root package.json with workspaces
     - packages/mcp-server/ - MCP server (npm: tradeblocks-mcp)
     - packages/agent-skills/ - Agent skill definitions
     - How to run commands per workspace (`npm run X -w packages/mcp-server`)
  4. **Update environment section**: Mention Jest 30 test runner (current), confirm Node 20 LTS still accurate
  5. **Cross-reference MCP docs**: Add link to MCP server development info where relevant

  Keep existing accurate content. Only modify what's stale or missing.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Read updated docs/development.md
  - Confirm no Recharts mention (should be Plotly)
  - Confirm monorepo section exists
  - Confirm stale roadmap removed/updated
  </verify>
  <done>
  - development.md accurately reflects current architecture
  - Monorepo structure documented
  - No stale/incorrect information
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Refocus main README as navigation hub</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
  Refocus README.md as a repo navigation guide and development setup doc, not a feature brochure:

  1. **Keep brief "what is this"**: One paragraph explaining TradeBlocks (trading analytics + MCP server). Don't over-explain features.

  2. **Prioritize repo navigation**:
     - Clear monorepo structure overview (root app, packages/mcp-server, packages/agent-skills)
     - What lives where and how it fits together
     - Links to detailed docs for each area

  3. **Development-first quick start**:
     - Clone, install, run dev server
     - How to run MCP server locally for development
     - How to run tests
     - Workspace commands (`npm run X -w packages/mcp-server`)

  4. **Streamline feature lists**: Keep brief bullets about what each part does, but link to detailed docs rather than exhaustive feature lists in README

  5. **Documentation links table**: Keep this but ensure it's the primary navigation method - "go here for X"

  6. **Remove or minimize**:
     - Detailed CSV format specs (belongs in USAGE.md)
     - Exhaustive feature lists (link to package READMEs instead)

  Goal: Someone cloning the repo knows immediately how to get running and where to find things.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Read updated README.md
  - Confirm repo structure is clear
  - Confirm development setup is prominent
  - Check documentation links table is accurate
  </verify>
  <done>
  - README.md serves as navigation hub
  - Development setup is clear and prominent
  - Feature details delegated to appropriate package docs
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Review MCP documentation consistency</name>
  <files>packages/mcp-server/README.md, packages/mcp-server/docs/USAGE.md</files>
  <action>
  Review MCP server docs for consistency and accuracy:

  1. **Cross-reference tool counts**: Verify "19 MCP tools" claim is accurate (count in README vs USAGE.md vs actual tools)
  2. **Check installation instructions**: Ensure all platform configs (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) are current
  3. **Verify CLI commands**: Check that install-skills, uninstall-skills, check-skills commands are documented correctly
  4. **Review CSV format section**: Ensure USAGE.md CSV format matches main README and reflects flexible detection
  5. **Check cross-references**: Ensure links between README.md and USAGE.md work, links to agent-skills work
  6. **Verify import_csv caveat**: USAGE.md notes "CLI only - not available in Claude Desktop" - confirm this is still accurate

  Make targeted fixes where inconsistencies found.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Tool count matches across docs
  - All platform configuration examples are valid JSON/TOML
  - Cross-reference links work
  </verify>
  <done>
  - MCP docs internally consistent
  - Tool counts accurate
  - Platform configs verified
  - Links validated
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds (docs changes shouldn't break build, but verify)
- [ ] All documentation links verified (relative paths exist)
- [ ] No stale references to old architecture or removed features
- [ ] Consistent messaging across README.md, development.md, MCP docs
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- Documentation accurately represents v2.0 TradeBlocks
- Two audiences served: traders (users) and developers (contributors)
- MCP server featured as key v2.0 value proposition
