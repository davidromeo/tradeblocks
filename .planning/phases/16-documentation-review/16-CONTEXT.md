# Phase 16: Documentation Review - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A comprehensive overhaul of the documentation before v2.0 release. This isn't a quick audit — it's a thorough rewrite where needed to ensure the docs properly represent what TradeBlocks has become.

The main focus is the project-level documentation (root README, development docs), but the MCP server docs also need attention. The goal is that someone landing on the repo immediately understands:
1. What TradeBlocks is
2. How to get started (both as a user and as a developer)
3. What the MCP server adds to the picture

</vision>

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clear entry point** — A new visitor immediately understands what TradeBlocks is and how to start using it
- **Dual audience** — Works for both traders wanting to use it AND developers wanting to run/contribute
- **MCP story integrated** — The MCP server isn't an afterthought, it's a key part of the v2.0 value proposition

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- No specific exclusions identified — open to whatever improvements make sense
- Focus is on main project docs and MCP server docs (agent skills docs lower priority)

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard documentation approaches that achieve clarity for both user types.

## Additional Context

The main README was just updated in this session with MCP server info, but user wants a more comprehensive look to ensure everything hangs together well before the v2.0 release.

Key docs to review:
- `/README.md` (main project)
- `/docs/development.md`
- `/packages/mcp-server/README.md`
- `/packages/mcp-server/docs/USAGE.md`
- `/packages/agent-skills/README.md`
