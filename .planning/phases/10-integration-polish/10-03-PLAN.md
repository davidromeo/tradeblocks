<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update ISSUES.md with resolutions</name>
  <files>.planning/ISSUES.md</files>
  <action>Update ISSUES.md to close all resolved issues:

  1. Move ISS-001 to "Closed Enhancements" section with resolution note:
     "RESOLVED: Phase 6 restructuring wrapped all results in `{results && ...}` guards. No empty placeholder cards appear before analysis runs."

  2. Move ISS-004 to "Closed Enhancements" section with resolution note:
     "RESOLVED: Phase 10-01 added validatePreRunConfiguration function and pre-run guidance display in Configuration card."

  3. Update ISS-002 and ISS-003 status (they should already be marked resolved but ensure they're moved to Closed section with notes).

  Leave "Open Enhancements" section empty or with a note "No open enhancements".</action>
  <verify>ISSUES.md has all 4 issues in Closed section with resolution notes</verify>
  <done>All issues documented as resolved with clear resolution notes</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md</name>
  <files>.planning/STATE.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>Update project tracking files:

  STATE.md:
  1. Update Current Position: Phase 10 of 10 complete
  2. Update Status: Milestone complete
  3. Update Progress bar: 100% (all plans complete)
  4. Add any final decisions from Phase 10 to Decisions table
  5. Clear Deferred Issues section (all resolved)
  6. Update Session Continuity with final status

  ROADMAP.md:
  1. Mark Phase 10 plans as complete: [x] 10-01, [x] 10-02, [x] 10-03
  2. Update Progress table: Phase 10 | 3/3 | Complete | [date]
  3. Mark Phase 10 checkbox: [x] Phase 10: Integration & Polish</action>
  <verify>STATE.md shows 100% complete, ROADMAP.md has all phases checked</verify>
  <done>Both tracking files updated to reflect milestone completion</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Run final verification checks</name>
  <files>N/A (verification only)</files>
  <action>Run comprehensive verification:

  1. `npm run lint` - Ensure no linting errors
  2. `npm test` - Ensure all tests pass
  3. `npm run build` - Ensure production build succeeds

  Document results. If any failures, note them for immediate fix before marking complete.

  **AVOID**: Don't skip this step. A "complete" milestone with failing tests or build is not complete.</action>
  <verify>All three commands succeed with no errors</verify>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] ISSUES.md has all issues in Closed section
- [ ] STATE.md shows milestone complete
- [ ] ROADMAP.md has all phases marked complete
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npm test` passes
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All documentation updated to reflect completion
- All issues closed with resolution notes
- Codebase passes lint, test, and build
- Phase 10 (and entire milestone) complete
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-integration-polish/10-03-SUMMARY.md` with:
- Final accomplishments
- Milestone summary (what was built across all phases)
- Any follow-up items for future work
</output>
